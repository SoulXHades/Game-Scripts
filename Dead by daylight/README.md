# About
dbd.py is a python script that runs in the background for the game, Dead by daylight (https://store.steampowered.com/app/381210/Dead_by_Daylight/). Using hotkeys, scripts are executed to do different stuff. The point of this creating this script was to eliminate the need to spam keys in the game, worrying of reducing key's lifespan.


# Requirement
* python3
* keyboard library (pip install keyboard)


# Hotkeys
* c - Struggle when carried by killer
* h - Struggle in hook (key setting must be using space bar to struggle)
* = - Run straight
* e - End the script (press and hold E key for 2 secs to ensure the script full stops)
